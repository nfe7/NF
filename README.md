I am a graduate in Financial Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.

I am passionate about building algorithms, analyzing complex datasets, and developing robust software solutions. My research interests include Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance.

I currently divide my time between independent learning and coaching chess part-time. I am looking for the right opportunity to apply my skills in a challenging, fast-paced setting.
